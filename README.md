# EasySchedules
Easy Schedules is an intuitive weekly schedule viewer. Place files into Data/ and access all of your employee's schedules! Employees can view their schedule and availability, modify their avilability, or pick up available shifts. Managers can choose to view the roster by all employees, specific job types, or by each individual employee. Managers can also write employees into the shift by simply typing text appropriate for the current view. Finally, managers can add open shifts for employees to pick up and remove employees currently on the schedule.
